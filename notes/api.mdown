# Endpoint Basics

* Get end-points need cross origin header set to allow communication from client to server

* There needs to be a function set up with `res` and `req` in order to make it work, a simple return of value won't

```
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost:3000');
  res.json('Hard coded text');
}
```
